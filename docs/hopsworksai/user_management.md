# User management
In Hopsworks.ai users can be grouped into *organizations* to access the same resources.
When a new user registers with Hopsworks.ai a new organization is created. This user later on can
invite other registered users to their organization so they can share access to the same clusters.

Cloud Accounts configuration is also shared among users of the same organization. So if user Alice has configured
her account with her credentials, all member of her *organization* will automatically deploy clusters in her cloud
account. Credits and cluster usage are also grouped to ease reporting.

## Adding members to an organization
Organization membership can be edited by clicking **Members** on the left of Hopsworks.ai Dashboard page.

To add a new member to your organization add the user's email and click **Add**. The invited user will
receive an email with the invitation.

An invited user **must accept** the invitation to be part of the organization. An invitation will show up in
the invited member's Dashboard. In this example Alice has invited Bob to her organization, but Bob hasn't accepted
the invitation yet.

## Sharing resources
Once Bob has accepted the invitation he does **not** have to configure his account, they share the same configuration.
Also, he will be able to view **the same** Dashboard as Alice, so he can start, stop or terminate clusters in the organization.

If Alice had existing clusters running and she had selected [Managed user management](../aws/cluster_creation/#step-9-user-management-selection)
during cluster creation, an account will be automatically created for Bob on these clusters.

## Removing members from an organization
To remove a member from your organization simply go to **Members** page and click the **Remove** button next to the user you want to remove.
You will **stop** sharing any resource and the user **will be blocked** from any shared cluster.
