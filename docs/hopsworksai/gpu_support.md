# GPU support
Hopsworks can harness the power of GPUs to speed up machine learning processes. You can take advantage of this feature in Hopsworks.ai by adding GPU equipped workers to your cluster. This can be done in two way: creating a cluster with GPU equipped workers or adding GPU equipped workers to an existing cluster.

## Creating a cluster with GPU equipped workers
When selecting the [workers' instance type](aws/cluster_creation.md#step-2-setting-the-general-information) during the cluster creation, you can select an instance type equipped with GPUs. The cluster will then be created and Hopsworks will automatically detect the GPU resource.

## Adding GPU equipped workers to an existing cluster.
When [adding workers](adding_removing_workers.md#adding-workers) to a cluster, you can select an instance type equipped with GPUs. The workers will then be added to the cluster and Hopsworks will automatically detect the new GPU resource.

## Using the GPUs
Once workers with GPUs have been added to your cluster you can use them by allocating GPUs to JupyterLab or Jobs.
